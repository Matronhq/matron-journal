// Panic lock (docs/protocol.md "Panic lock"): an external watcher holding a
// panic token bound to one account locks that account with one request.
// The journal signs out every client device of the account (but one that
// holds an approval key, which is frozen instead), turns the
// Coordinator's consent switches off, refuses new sign-ins and device links
// for it, refuses to deliver new work to its boxes, and tells every bridge
// of the account to lock. The token can only lock (and read whether the
// account is locked); the lock is cleared on the journal host
// (`matron-admin panic clear <user>`), or by a frozen device with a
// statement signed by its approval key (POST /panic/unlock).
//
// This module is the state and its checks, imported by every path that
// refuses while locked; the lock itself and the routes are in
// src/panic-lock.js, which the HTTP handler alone imports.
//
// The state is one row per account in `panic_locks`; locked means a row
// with `cleared_at` NULL. Every check reads the database (a primary-key
// lookup), never memory, so the CLI's clear takes effect at once for the
// refusals and a journal restart cannot forget a lock.
