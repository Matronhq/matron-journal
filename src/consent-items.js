// conversation, and the ANSWER closes it — the item is a MIRROR of the
// spawn row, never a second source of truth: answering still happens on
// the card (POST /agent-spawn/answer), and the row's state machine decides
// what the item says.
//
// The one invariant: a consent item is open exactly while its ask is
// 'awaiting_user'. An approved spawn leaves that state at the answer, long
// before its outcome (the target box may be woken first, minutes), so the
// approval itself closes the item and the outcome only adds a note. An item
// left open on an ask that is not waiting is offered to the user as a
// decision that can only fail with 409; reconcileConsentItems is the sweep
// that closes any such item, however it came about.
//
// The pure half (fields, closing text) comes first; the two side-effecting
// halves (file, close) follow and are best-effort by contract: the
