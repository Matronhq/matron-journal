// The "People" system conversation (spec 2026-10-02 matron-to-matron
// sharing, phase 1). A user's log is theirs alone and every event needs a
// conversation, but a contact request from another person arrives with no
// conversation in common. So each user gets ONE conversation the journal
// itself owns: the home of cards that come from other people, of those
// cards' tracker mirrors, and of the contact/grant audit events.
//
// It has no agent, and no agent may read, write or adopt it. The guards
// live where each path is decided — upsertConversation and agentTargetsFor
// (journal.js), authorizeAgentWrite (auth.js), /snapshot and /roster
// (http.js) — and all of them ask isSystemConvo. Looked up by its
// `system` marker, never by id, so an agent upserting a guessable id first
// gains nothing.
