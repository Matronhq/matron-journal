// when the conversation has a repo whose `host/org` scope both the viewer
// and the owner are verified members of (an `ok` GitHub link each), and
// the conversation's agent device is known, belongs to the conversation's
// owner (devices.id is a reusable rowid: a revoked id later handed to
// another user's public box must confer nothing), and is not private — a revoked
// device fails closed. One SQL fragment, one function; every widened route
// uses these and nothing else, the way privacy.js is the only copy of the
// private-device sieve.
//
// The fragment binds the viewer as the NAMED parameter @viewer, so a caller
// can splice it into a larger statement without counting positional
// placeholders. It expresses the ORG rule only: callers that also want the
// owner to pass add `<alias>.owner_user_id = @viewer OR (...)`.

// a contact that is the viewer, and the two contact rows — the owner's and
// the viewer's own — are both active. Either side ending the contact, or
// either side revoking the grant, closes it at once: nothing is cached.

// their attachments) and never a transcript (spec decision 6), so

// per-conversation milestone list stay closed to a grantee. What a grantee
// sees of a granted mission is built in missions.js (grantedMissionDetail)
